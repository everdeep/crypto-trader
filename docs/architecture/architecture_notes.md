Use a microservice architecture: A microservice architecture allows you to break down your application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. For example, you can have a service responsible for tracking symbols, another service for executing trades, and yet another service for generating alerts.

Use a message broker: A message broker like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ can be used to handle communication between different services. This allows you to decouple your services and scale them independently. For example, if one service is receiving a lot of traffic, you can scale it up without affecting the other services.

Use a database to store user data and symbol data: You can use a relational database like MySQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB to store user data and symbol data. Each user can have their own database schema or collection. This allows you to scale the database horizontally by adding more nodes to handle more traffic.

Use a job queue: A job queue like Celery can be used to handle asynchronous tasks. For example, when a user creates a new strategy, you can add it to the job queue to be processed asynchronously. This allows you to handle more requests without blocking the main thread.

Use a cache: A cache like Redis can be used to store frequently accessed data. For example, if you have a service that retrieves symbol data from the database, you can cache the data in Redis to improve performance.

Use a load balancer: A load balancer like NGINX or HAProxy can be used to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application. This allows you to handle more requests without overloading a single instance.

Use a container orchestration tool: A container orchestration tool like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm can be used to manage your containers and scale them up or down as needed. This allows you to handle more traffic without having to manually manage individual containers.
